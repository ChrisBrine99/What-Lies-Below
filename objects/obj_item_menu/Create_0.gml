#region EDITING INHERITED VARIABLES

// Inherit all variables from the parent menu class
event_inherited();
// First, initialize the menu itself
//menu_initialize(-1, -1, 4, 6, 0, 30, 0.4); // TODO -- Place transition and its arguments where the -1s are located
// Next, initialize the menu option variables
//menu_init_options(20, 20, fa_center, fa_top, 0, 0, font_gui_medium);
// NOTE -- The item menu will use images in place of options being represented with text, which is the norm.
// The only item name that will be visible is the item that is currently highlighted by the player; located
// below the item grid
